## Beam Haxe API Port Core Library

All target / platform agnostic Beam API code goes here.

The Beam API and other cool code can be found here: https://github.com/WatchBeam/

## Why Port to Haxe?

Haxe is a very portable language that allows devs to write code once and then compile it for various different targets / platforms. Makes writing code much simpler.
